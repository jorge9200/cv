      "description": "Hello everyone! I'm Jorge and I'm passionate about technology. \n\nI've been programming and immersed in technology for 14 years. I love learning, working with the latest technologies and being involved in my projects as much as possible. I am addicted to planning, organising and I love to document and develop all my projects with extreme care.\n\nI have worked with most of the typical stacks of a cloud architecture, from frontend frameworks like React.js, AngularJs or VueJs to backend ones; Node.js, kubernetes, docker, mysql, mongo.db...\n\nI specialise in the use of Javascript and front-end development. I started a long time ago working on vanilla Javascript with jQuery and at the moment I prefer a combination of ReactJs and NextJs to develop my applications.\n\nI have also worked in managing the technical team, planning projects, designing products and their architecture, interviewing developers, training them, working on the board as a partner in my own company, and helping with business development and fundraising. \n\nOf all this, I still love coding, managing small teams and being part of product development from the beginning.",

One that hosts all the services and products offered to the client, and another that provides a template system of tables and formularies managed by JSON objects that are used by the rest of the company's teams.\n\nThe role consists of taking the lead on the front-end side of these applications, working on the possible enhancements, refactoring and also the bugs that we may have. \n\nOur main goal is to refactor and almost completely redevelop the way the two applications work. For the hosting application, the routing system was causing a lot of problems and it was not very easy for the hosted micro-applications to modify it. For the templates application, we needed to refactor the entire client validation system to allow more possible combinations and fix the ones we were already using."

A company focused on developing the web operating system, a web that looks and works like a computer. Where you could use your applications with your files, anywhere and on any device.\n\nIn this second stage of the company, we raised a $1 million fund and changed the organisation of the development team to smaller teams per business vertical with a more full-stack approach. I led the team that focused on the B2B part of the business, building the tools and technology for that.\n\nThinking from scratch about what needed to be done, helping to design it from the UI/UX side and designing the code architecture of the new feature. Finally, developing, testing and maintaining the new features. On the server side we worked with AWS, Node.Js, Kubernetes and Docker. For the client side, we started working with vanilla Javascript with jQuery or Canvas on top of it and ended up with the latest frameworks that everyone is using now, in this case trying React.Js.\n\nAs a partner in the company, I was on the board of directors, designing the roadmap of the company and helping with any problems that might arise in the business side. So I worked on fundraising projects, travelling around the world to raise money for the company, I worked as a commercial, selling our product via email and in the field, and as a product developer, designing how the product would evolve.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmxjWbEnJms\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amauo9XTfqQ"

A company focused on developing the web operating system, a web that looks and works like a computer. Where you could use your applications with your files, anywhere and on any device.\n\nIn this first stage of the company we started to build this web operative system, building from scratch all the applications needed to fulfil the needs of a casual user. We developed a text editor, a calendar, a file system application, video and audio players and all the rest of the typical standard applications that come with a computer. Our vision for the company was to leave the entire front end open source, as we wanted it to grow with the participation of the user community, so all these applications can be found in the company's repository https://github.com/Inevio.\n\nAt the beginning there were only 4 of us and I stayed on as the lead for the front-end side of the application. We started to grow quickly and got to about 12 in the first year. As the front-end lead, I was responsible for designing the architecture for the front-end side, managing the front-end developers and developing the actual standard initial applications for the product.\n\nAs a partner in the company, I was on the board of directors, designing the roadmap of the company and helping with any problems that might arise in the business side. So I worked on fundraising projects, travelling around the world to raise money for the company, I worked as a commercial, selling our product via email and in the field, and as a product developer, designing how the product would evolve.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph7nDKYyaqE"

Arrange the file tree in a specific order:\n 3.a Folders should be displayed before files.\n 3.b All items should be sorted alphabetically, regardless of uppercase or lowercase letters.\n4. Any changes you make to file contents must persist for the duration of the session and save automatically.\n5. Include tests in the code.\n\nSecondary Goals\n1.

    "desiredJobDescription": "I would love to work in a company with a 'small company culture'. Where all opinions matter and the focus is always on making the best of it. \n\nI like companies with a focus on one product, where the whole team is involved in the design, growth and development of that product. I love working with and trying out the latest technologies and always working with the best tools.\n\nI love being flexible and working from home, but I also love building a family and getting together with colleagues.\n\nI'm a big fan of video games, music, motorcycles and photography so it would be great if I can relate to that too.",
    "goodPractices": "I understand and apply SOLID, KISS, YAGNI... Personally, it has been difficult for me to find a project in my career where TDD was a priority, although I consider testing an indispensable part of development and I always apply it, both unit and integration testing. \n\nI am used to working in high performance teams, applying continuous CD/CI and I love cleanliness and simplicity. Last but not least, I'm used to work in SCRUM and other agile methodologies.\n\n",

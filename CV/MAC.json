      "description": "Hello everyone! I'm Jorge and I'm passionate about technology. \n\nI've been programming and immersed in technology for 14 years. I love learning, working with the latest technologies and being involved in my projects as much as possible. I am addicted to planning, organising and I love to document and develop all my projects with extreme care.\n\nI have worked with most of the typical stacks of a cloud architecture, from frontend frameworks like React.js, AngularJs or VueJs to backend ones; Node.js, kubernetes, docker, mysql, mongo.db...\n\nI specialise in the use of Javascript and front-end development. I started a long time ago working on vanilla Javascript with jQuery and at the moment I prefer a combination of ReactJs and NextJs to develop my applications.\n\nI have also worked in managing the technical team, planning projects, designing products and their architecture, interviewing developers, training them, working on the board as a partner in my own company, and helping with business development and fundraising. \n\nOf all this, I still love coding, managing small teams and being part of product development from the beginning.",

One that hosts all the services and products offered to the client, and another that provides a template system of tables and formularies managed by JSON objects that are used by the rest of the company's teams.\n\nThe role consists of taking the lead on the front-end side of these applications, working on the possible enhancements, refactoring and also the bugs that we may have. \n\nOur main goal is to refactor and almost completely redevelop the way the two applications work. For the hosting application, the routing system was causing a lot of problems and it was not very easy for the hosted micro-applications to modify it. For the templates application, we needed to refactor the entire client validation system to allow more possible combinations and fix the ones we were already using."

Each File object has a path and contents property. The path is a string that represents the path to the file. The contents are a string that represents the contents of the file.\n\nMain Goals\n1. Show the files in a nested structure, with separate sections for each folder and file.\n2. Make sure the application can handle file structures of any complexity.\n3. Arrange the file tree in a specific order:\n 3.a Folders should be displayed before files.\n 3.b All items should be sorted alphabetically, regardless of uppercase or lowercase letters.\n4. Any changes you make to file contents must persist for the duration of the session and save automatically.\n5. Include tests in the code.\n\nSecondary Goals\n1. Implement a feature to move files to a different folder via drag and drop.\n2. Ability to resize the panels (the file tree and the code editor).",

    "desiredJobDescription": "I would love to work in a company with a 'small company culture'. Where all opinions matter and the focus is always on making the best of it. \n\nI like companies with a focus on one product, where the whole team is involved in the design, growth and development of that product. I love working with and trying out the latest technologies and always working with the best tools.\n\nI love being flexible and working from home, but I also love building a family and getting together with colleagues.\n\nI'm a big fan of video games, music, motorcycles and photography so it would be great if I can relate to that too.",
    "goodPractices": "I understand and apply SOLID, KISS, YAGNI... Personally, it has been difficult for me to find a project in my career where TDD was a priority, although I consider testing an indispensable part of development and I always apply it, both unit and integration testing. \n\nI am used to working in high performance teams, applying continuous CD/CI and I love cleanliness and simplicity. Last but not least, I'm used to work in SCRUM and other agile methodologies.\n\n",
